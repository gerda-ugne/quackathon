# Quackathon 2020 - University of Dundee

We tackled the ChilliConnect challenge for the 2020 Quackathon event, which took event in University of Dundee on February 1-2 2020. After 24 hours of no sleep and hard work, we are proud to announce that the project won!

### Challenge Summary
Create a game with textual interface and that uses asynchronous/passive model of gameplay.

## Snappy Ducks

### Backstory of the game:

Our hero, duck Beacky, comes back to her home pond and meets her old friend Quilly. They both notice that the problem of pollution is even worse than the year before. Thus, they decide to fight back against the main cause of the pollution - humans. During their adventure they not only punish the polluters by scaring them but also clean up the pond from litter.

### Summary
The game displays the pond map. Beacky is marked as letter B on the map, and her friend Quilly as letter Q. The obstacles are marked as ¥ and the human polluters, which ducks can fight, as ☻. Trash is marked as *. You start the game as Beacky, but you are allowed to switch the perspectives and play as Quilly anytime.


### End Goal:
Scare all the humans away and collect all the litter to save the ecosystem and restore peace in your home pond.

### Rules:

You start the game as the duck Beacky.

The game contains a map which represents a pond. You can move around by following the directions displayed on screen.
The pond contains many obstacles, so make sure you don't lose your way!

Unfortunately, there are many tourists who've come to visit your idyllic home pond. They happen to leave their litter everywhere. If you pick the litter up, you can find valuable resources (nutrients and wax) to aid you in combat.

Since humans are disturbing your peace, you can fight them to support the ecosystem. You have limited resources to fight humans. You must keep an eye on your health bar and your energy at all times. Remember that wax helps your feathers, and that rocks are
important to help your digestion.

If a tourist overpowers you, you will lose your consciousness and float
to the shore. But if you manage to win the fight, the human polluter will leave the area and leave no more trash behind!

But it might also be interesting to discover the pond from Quilly's perspective. After some time, Beacky will need a rest, and Quilly can take over. That does not prevent you from switching the perspective whenever you want to in the main menu.

Together you will be able to clear the pond of the litter and those who leave it.
Save the ecosystem with Beacky and Quilly!
